- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
- PSR-4 autoloading
- Composer for dependency management
- Clean, well-documented code following PSR coding standards

### Get started
- Clone the repository - `git clone git@github.com:ahamed/ollyo-php-developer-task.git`
- Run `cd ollyo-php-developer-task`
- Run `composer install`

### What to do?
1. Complete the View System
   - Navigate to `/helper.php` and implement the view() function
   - Function should accept view name and data array parameters
   - Handle loading view files from /src/Views directory

   - Create `failure.php` view in /src/Views showing:
     - Error message
     - Reason for failure
     - Try again button
     - Contact support information

3. Complete the Checkout View
   - Calculate subtotal from products array
   - Add shipping cost calculation
   - Validate all required customer fields

   - Manage subscription status

9. Project Completion
   - Push completed code to GitHub
   - Include setup instructions in README
   - Document API endpoints
   - Share repository link

*Note: If you need to modify the system core files to complete the requirements then feel free to do it. Some errors in the codebase are intentional and should be fixed as part of the task.*
